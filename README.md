# BloomEval: A Bloomâ€™s Cognitive Taxonomy-Based Benchmark for Evaluating Thinking Capability of Large Reasoning Models
We propose a large-scale, fine-grained dataset comprising 94,602 math problems spanning K-12 to higher education, each annotated with Bloom's cognitive level labels, problem parameter annotations, and cognitive level-aligned solve steps. The following is an example of the data, all of which will be available for download after the paper is accepted.
